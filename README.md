## Project Topic: E-commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview 
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of the E-comerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which can help us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten as well as to know the best performance from our data.
